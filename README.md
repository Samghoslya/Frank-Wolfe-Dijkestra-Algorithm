# Frank-Wolfe-Dijkestra-Algorithm
Analysis is done for Sioux Falls Network to find equilibrium O-D travel times, equilibrium link flows, link travel times, and shortest O-D paths in a static assignment case

**How to Start**
* keep all the files in same repository 

**Steps:**
* Run Frank_Wolfe_and_Dijkestra.py
* It will first run the Frank Wolfe Algorithm and compute the equilibrium travel times and flows for all links on Wardrop's First and second principal
* After it will run Dijkestra algorithm to find the shortest path routes and travel times from each origin to each destination
