# Frank-Wolfe-Dijkestra-Algorithm
Analysis is done for Sioux Falls Netword to find equilibrium travel time, flows and shortest paths in a static case

**How to Start**
* keep all the files in same repository 

**Step:**
* Run Frank_Wolfe_and_Dijkestra.py
* It will first run the Frank Wolfe Algorithm and compute the equilibrium travel times and flows for all links on the principle of Wardrop's First and second principal
* Later it will run Dijkestra algorithm to find the shortest path route and travel times from each origin to destination
